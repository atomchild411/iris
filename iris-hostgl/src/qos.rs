//! What the scheduler is told about a thread of ours.
//!
//! This Mac has eight performance cores and four efficiency ones, and macOS
//! decides which a thread may run on largely from its quality-of-service
//! class. A thread left at the default class is eligible for an efficiency
//! core; a `USER_INTERACTIVE` one is kept on the performance cores. Threads
//! spawned by Rust get whatever `pthread_create` gives them, which here is the
//! default class -- `ps -M` shows the emulator's main thread at priority 46
//! and *every* thread it spawns at 31.
//!
//! That matters because two of the threads on a GL frame's path are created
//! per guest process: the channel's service thread and the device's ring
//! threads. Where they land is decided when the process starts and does not
//! change for its life -- which is the shape of the fast/slow states we have
//! been chasing, a roughly twofold difference fixed for a process's lifetime,
//! invisible to every counter inside the guest and to every resource check
//! outside it.
//!
//! So the threads that carry a frame say what they are. They are latency
//! critical and tiny: a service thread is idle until a message arrives and
//! then must answer at once. Nothing else is raised -- this is not a licence
//! to mark everything important.
//!
//! `IRIS_HOSTGL_QOS=default` leaves them alone, so the same binary can be
//! measured both ways. That is the point: a difference between two builds
//! proves much less than a difference between two runs of one.
