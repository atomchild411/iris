//! What depends on the platform's GL: making contexts, finding entry points,
//! and a render target the CPU can read without a readback.
//!
//! Everything else in the crate -- the call replay, drawables, the swap -- is
//! OpenGL itself (legacy/compatibility profile, EXT_framebuffer_object and
//! EXT_framebuffer_blit), so a second backend (EGL + Zink, say) implements
//! this trait and nothing more. Its GL entry points must then be the ones the
//! `gl` module links: that module names OpenGL.framework today and would
//! grow a `cfg` for the other library.
