# The Khronos OpenGL API Registry, pinned

`gl.xml` is the OpenGL API Registry from
<https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry>, unmodified:

It is kept here so that regenerating the host GL protocol needs no network and
behaves the same on every platform. Only `../glapi_from_registry.py` reads it,
and only when the protocol is regenerated; building IRIS does not.

To move to a newer registry: replace `gl.xml`, update the commit and checksum
above, run `glapi_from_registry.py` and `glshim.py`, and check that
`iris-hostgl/src/calls.rs` and the guest's encoders change only where you
expect -- the registry has renamed parameters and retyped them before.
