//! Host services for IRIX programs, reached through a private system call.
//!
//! An IRIX program asks IRIS for something the emulated machine does not have
//! -- host-accelerated OpenGL, for one -- by making an ordinary `syscall` with a
//! number the IRIX kernel does not use. IRIS sees the instruction before it
//! raises the exception, answers the call itself, and resumes the program at the
//! next instruction. The kernel never runs, so nothing in IRIX changes.
//!
//! **Numbers.** IRIX numbers its calls from 1000; the highest in 6.5 is
//! `linkfollow`, 1234. [`FIRST`]..=[`LAST`] (3000-3009) are ours: 3000 is GL,
//! the rest are reserved for later services. On a real Indy, or IRIS built
//! without this, an indirect call to any of them fails with EINVAL -- measured
//! on real IRIX, not assumed -- which is how a library finds out it is not
//! running here and falls back.
//!
//! **Registers**, the IRIX convention plus one outcome of our own:
//!
//! | outcome   | `a3` | `v0`              | `v1`                         |
//! |-----------|------|-------------------|------------------------------|
//! | success   | 0    | result            | second result                |
//! | error     | 1    | errno             | -                            |
//! | need page | 1    | [`ENEEDPAGE`]     | page address, bit 0 = write  |
//!
//! Arguments are in `$4`..`$11` whatever the program's ABI (the caller's stub
//! loads them). Callers should use IRIX's **indirect** form -- `v0` = 1000,
//! the host call's number in `$4`, seven arguments in `$5`..`$11` -- because on
//! a real kernel a *direct* unknown number raises SIGSYS as well as failing
//! with EINVAL, while the indirect form only fails. So a library can probe for
//! IRIS without installing a signal handler. Both forms are answered here.
//!
//! **Need page.** IRIS sees physical memory and the TLB; it cannot walk IRIX's
//! page tables. When a call needs a page of the program's memory that has no
//! TLB entry, is not paged in, or is not yet writable (copy-on-write), the call
//! does nothing and answers [`ENEEDPAGE`] with that page. The caller touches it
//! -- reads a byte, or writes a byte back to itself for a write -- which makes
//! IRIX fault it in exactly as for any other access, and makes the call again.
//!
//! A call cannot simply check every page first: an R4400 TLB holds 48 entries,
//! so faulting in the 49th page of a buffer evicts an earlier one, and a call
//! that insists on all of them at once never succeeds. Progress is kept across
//! retries instead ([`InFlight`]): pages already read are held on the host,
//! pages already written are not written again. Services read and write
//! through [`GuestMemory`] and never see a retry except as `?` on a fault.
